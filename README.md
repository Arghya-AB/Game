# Terminal games in python

This is a game collection made using python. It also has tons of utility features including a login system, leaderboard, admin panel, player stats, guest mode and... a weird logo reveal in turtle.

# Games available

## Standard tic tac toe

This game is available in both single and multiplayer and is the standard 3x3 tic tac toe!

## 4x4 tic tac toe

This is a unique variation of tic tac toe where every player has 2 moves per chance! You just need to get 4 pieces on any diagonal, row or column in a row to win. The two move approach makes the game have evn more variations and strategies as you will see for yourself! It has both single and multiplayer modes.

## Stick Game

This is another new game concept. It's single player only against the computer. The player and computer will both remove some sticks with a mutually decided upper limit each turn. You win if the computer removes the last stick and lose if _you_ pick the last stick :P The computer is really good at this game ðŸ‘€
